# Quiz-of-doom
quiz project for coding bootcamp
<!-- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score -->

This project was brought on as an assignment for module 4 in our coding boot camp. This project could have been used for a review if the user wanted to use it that way. 

I built this project as another step in my journey to become a senior software engineer. 

This project could solve the problem of not having a way to review question having to do with our coding bootcamp. Although at this time, I found this project added more problems than it solved. 

 Learning is the number 1 goal in the class and this project forced me to learn more about vanilla JavaScript. I have a lot to learn but every time I sat down to code on this project I learned more. Obviously I still have a lot to learn, but learning is the journey!

 My project stands out! I am not sure it does in a good way YET but I will continue to work on it and turn it into the grade A project I know it can be. 

The features of this project are a timer that will index down. It has a start button that works and it has a text box that doesn't look great YET! 

I named this project the Quiz-of-doom because it seems that way right now but I have the oppertunity to master vanilla javascript. When I finish this project to my standards I will rename it appriopriatly.
